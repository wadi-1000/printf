# *C Group project*

## **0x11. C - printf**

### Description

A project where we create our own `printf` function and showcase how we use it in various ways.

0. Write a function that produces output according to a format.

	1. Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);

	2. Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)

	3. write output to stdout, the standard output stream

	4. format is a character string. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
	
	1. c
	2. s
	3. %

5. You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function

6. You don’t have to handle the flag characters

7. You don’t have to handle field width

8. You don’t have to handle precision

9. You don’t have to handle the length modifiers



1. Handle the following conversion specifiers:
	1. d
	2. i

3. You don’t have to handle the flag characters

4. You don’t have to handle field width

5. You don’t have to handle precision

6. You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
